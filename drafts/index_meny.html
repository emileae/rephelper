                                    To recap, last month I introduced the concept of a payback period
                                    which is important to understand when considering spending
                                    money on hot water technology. A payback will enable you to
                                    understand the potential for saving and how long the money you spend
                                    (the cost) will take to be repaid by the saving made.

                                    Insulation is one of the unsung heroes of the energy efficiency world that
                                    is often neglected when looking at methods to save energy. This is a low
                                    cost way to limit the loss or gain of heat or cold, which means savings
                                    on energy. Areas where insulation proves effective are keeping heat in
                                    (hot water or your house) or keeping the cold in (your fridge or house);
                                    or visa versa.
                                </p>
                                
                                <p>
                                    Research shows that insulation is still one of the better “business value”
                                    initiatives that can be implemented by a business to drive out energy
                                    savings. What do I mean by “business value”? – essentially value achieved
                                    by a business in implementing an intervention versus its related cost.
                                    The same is true for your home and specifically relating to your hot
                                    water. So what should you do?
                                </p>

                                    There are two ways to insulate for hot water. The first is to insulate your
                                    geyser and the second is to insulate (or clad) the hot water pipes leading
                                    from your geyser to your taps.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Geyser insulation, often commonly referred to as a “geyser blanket”, can
                                    help reduce the electricity a geyser uses. Insulation helps retard the rate at
                                    which a geyser cools when switched off and helps reduce the heat loss to
                                    the atmosphere while hot water is being stored. Less electricity is required
                                    to keep the water hot at the pre-set thermostat temperature or reheat the
                                    water after the geyser has been switched off (e.g. when using a timer).
                                    Tests have shown that up 20% of the electricity used to heat water can
                                    be saved by insulating the geyser.

                                    Insulating the pipes is a similar process to wrapping the geyser in blanket
                                    but typically saves less. This is because a smaller volume of hot water
                                    in the hot water pipes is kept warm. Pipes are wrapped in insulated
                                    cladding material similar to how you would wrap a limb in a bandage.
                                    This is can be difficult to install as pipe work may be difficult to access.
                                    Cost: R300 (excluding installation – this can typically be done as a DIY
                                    job).

                                    Insulating the pipes is a similar process to wrapping the geyser in blanket

                                    To recap, last month I introduced the concept of a payback period
                                    which is important to understand when considering spending
                                    money on hot water technology. A payback will enable you to
                                    understand the potential for saving and how long the money you spend
                                    (the cost) will take to be repaid by the saving made.
                                </p>

                                    We started to look at low cost technology covering efficient shower
                                    heads. Have you checked your shower heads to see if they are efficient?
                                    If they are inefficient, have you bought an efficient fitting yet?
                                </p>

                                    Every month you delay the decision will cost you. I will now continue to
                                    address the next of low cost interventions – insulation.

                                <p>
                                    Insulation is one of the unsung heroes of the energy efficiency world that
                                    is often neglected when looking at methods to save energy. This is a low
                                    cost way to limit the loss or gain of heat or cold, which means savings
                                    on energy. Areas where insulation proves effective are keeping heat in
                                    (hot water or your house) or keeping the cold in (your fridge or house);
                                    or visa versa.
                                </p>
                                
                                <p>
                                    Research shows that insulation is still one of the better “business value”
                                    initiatives that can be implemented by a business to drive out energy
                                    savings. What do I mean by “business value”? – essentially value achieved
                                    by a business in implementing an intervention versus its related cost.
                                    The same is true for your home and specifically relating to your hot
                                    water. So what should you do?
                                </p>
                                
                                <p>
                                    There are two ways to insulate for hot water. The first is to insulate your
                                    geyser and the second is to insulate (or clad) the hot water pipes leading
                                    from your geyser to your taps.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Geyser insulation, often commonly referred to as a “geyser blanket”, can
                                    help reduce the electricity a geyser uses. Insulation helps retard the rate at
                                    which a geyser cools when switched off and helps reduce the heat loss to
                                    the atmosphere while hot water is being stored. Less electricity is required
                                    to keep the water hot at the pre-set thermostat temperature or reheat the
                                    water after the geyser has been switched off (e.g. when using a timer).
                                    Tests have shown that up 20% of the electricity used to heat water can
                                    be saved by insulating the geyser.
